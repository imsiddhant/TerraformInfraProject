# Terraform Infrastructure Project

**Automated Infrastructure Provisioning for a Web Application:**

**Description:**
Create a Terraform configuration to provision all the necessary infrastructure components on AWS for hosting a web application. This project will include setting up networking, compute resources, databases, and security groups.

**Steps:**

1. **Networking Setup:**
   - Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets.
   - Configure route tables and internet gateways for public subnet access.

2. **Compute Resources:**
   - Launch EC2 instances to host the web application.
   - Use Auto Scaling Groups to ensure high availability and scalability.
   - Utilize Elastic Load Balancing for distributing incoming traffic.

3. **Database Configuration:**
   - Set up a managed database service like Amazon RDS for storing application data.
   - Choose the appropriate database engine (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) based on your application's requirements.

4. **Security and Access Control:**
   - Implement security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances and databases.
